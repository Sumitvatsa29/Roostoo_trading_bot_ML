## üìä Overview

Roostoo Trading Bot combines technical analysis with machine learning to identify and execute potential trading opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. The system implements a hybrid approach using mean reversion principles alongside deep learning predictions to make informed trading decisions.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER:** This bot uses a mock API (Roostoo) for demonstration purposes only. It was trained on historical 2021 Bitcoin data and should not be used for actual trading without extensive further development and testing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit these parameters in `trading_bot.py`:

```python
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL = "https://mock-api.roostoo.com/v3"
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key_here"

# Trading Parameters
CRYPTOS = [{"symbol": "BTC/USD", "name": "Bitcoin", "weight": 0.5}]
TRADING_INTERVAL = 40  # seconds between checks
INITIAL_BALANCE = 10000  # starting virtual balance
```

## üìà Trading Strategy

The bot implements a sophisticated hybrid strategy:

1. **Mean Reversion Detection**
   - Calculates moving average bands to identify price deviations
   - Looks for potential reversions to the mean

2. **RSI Momentum Filtering**
   - Uses RSI (Relative Strength Index) to confirm momentum direction
   - Filters out false signals with divergence detection

3. **LSTM Price Prediction**
   - Utilizes deep learning to forecast short-term price movements
   - Integrates predictions with technical signals for higher confidence trades

4. **Position Management**
   - Dynamically sizes positions based on conviction score
   - Implements take-profit and stop-loss mechanisms

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Component

The LSTM neural network was designed to recognize patterns in cryptocurrency price movements:

- Trained on 2021 Bitcoin historical minute-level data
- Features engineered from price, volume, and technical indicators
- Optimized for short-term forecasting (5-15 minute horizon)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This bot uses mock API endpoints and will not execute real trades
- The LSTM model was trained on specific historical data only and requires retraining for current market conditions
- Extensive backtesting is recommended before considering live trading
- No guarantee of profitability; cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile
